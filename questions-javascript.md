## OOP in JavaScript



### What is object-oriented programming (OOP)?

- A widely accepted definition of OOP that is used to classify a language as "object-oriented" is based on two requirements:
    * its capability to model a problem through objects
    * its support of a few principles that grant modularity (break code into smaller pieces) and code reuse
- Those two requirements can each be broken down into three principles.
- Here is the first requirement broken down:
    * Association: an objects capability to refer to another independent object
        - `var bill = {name: 'Bill'}`
        - `var steve = {name: 'Steve'}`
        - `steve.parent = bill;`
        - Here, we have two objects and there is an association created between these two completely independent objects
    * Aggregation: the aboject's capability to embed one or more *independent* objects
        - `var company = {name: 'ABC Corporation', employees: []}`
        - `company.employees.push(bill);`
        - A different object, `company`, has a property `employees` which holds an array. I can add the `bill` object to that array
    * Composition: the object's capability to embed one or more *dependent* objects
        - `bill.address = {street: '123 Main Street', city: 'Philadelphia', state: 'PA'}`
        - The `address` property is just an object with multiple properties for Bill's address. It is a dependent object because it doesn't exist outside of `bill`
- Here is the second component broken down:
    * Encapsulation: This is the capability to concentrate into a single entity data and code that manipulates it, hiding its internal details
        - there is nothing *natively* in JavaScript that hides internal details. All properties are public automatically. But there are techniques that can be used to mimic the principle of encapsulation.
    * Inheritance: This is the mechanism by which an object acquires some or all features from one or more other objects
        - JavaScript has prototypal inheritance which is a complicated subject. It isn't exactly *inheritance* the way other "classical languages" use it but there is an inheritance mechanism that allows an object to have access to the methods of its prototype object.
    * Polymorphism: This is the capability to process objects differently based on their data type or structure
        - This is a definition I found:

> Generally, the ability to appear in many forms. In object-oriented programming, polymorphism refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class. More specifically, it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.

### Lay the foundation for OOP in JavaScript. Why is it so different than other languages?

- This is a super-quick overview of object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
- JavaScript is different than "classical languages" in how it does inheritance. This is so important because that is essentially how object-oriented programming works: a class of objects with certain behaviors/properties that can be passed down to instances of that object OR serve as a parent class of another class of objects.
- JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance which means instead of a property being "passed down" or copied into the "child" object or class, what's really happening is *behavior delegation*. 
- Behavior delegation is essentially when a programmer asks for a method/property on an object, if that property isn't there, it looks to its *prototype* or *parent* object for that property. This is called the prototype chain.
- Instead of "copying down" the methods/properties, the child object "delegate up" the prototype chain in search of that method or property. So it could theoretically go from *child object* to *parent object*; if the method isn't there, it could go from *parent object* to *grandparent object* looking for the method/property. Eventually, it goes up the chain until you find the method. That chain ends with the parent for **all** objects in JavaScript, the Object, wherein if the method/property isn't there, it is `undefined`.
- So with that foundation, I've learned that object-oriented JavaScript is really an implementation of OOP principles using different techniques to mimic certain features that the language doesn't natively support.
- In addition to the major feature I mentioned above, **inheritance**, there are patterns and best practices of how to implement certain other features of OOP like private properties, getter/setter functions, etc.

### Explain the difference between prototypal and classical inheritance.

- "Classical" inheritance is really talking about the methods of object orientation.
- A "class" that acts as a blueprint or architectual diagram for an object and then you need to create an instance of that class in JavaScript, inheritance works using prototypes - in prototypal inheritance, new objects are created using previously created objects.
    + there is a parent "Object" for all objects in JavaScript
- There is a method of JavaScript of emulating the more classical object-oriented form using classes and that's called the Pseudo-Classical Pattern but, again, it's only faking it...all inheritance in JavaScript is prototypal

> **Class Inheritance**: instances inherit from classes (like a blueprint — a description of the class), and create sub-class relationships: hierarchical class taxonomies. Instances are typically instantiated via constructor functions with the `new` keyword. Class inheritance may or may not use the `class` keyword from ES6.

> **Prototypal Inheritance**: instances inherit directly from other objects. Instances are typically instantiated via factory functions or `Object.create()`. Instances may be composed from many different objects, allowing for easy selective inheritance.

- [Quora: What is Prototypal Inheritance?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-prototypal-inheritance/answer/Kyle-Simpson)
- [Medium: 10 JavaScript Interview Questions](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-interview-questions-every-javascript-developer-should-know-6fa6bdf5ad95)

### Show a basic example of object-oriented JavaScript: properties, methods, instantiation.

```js
function Person(first_name, last_name) {
    this.first_name = first_name;   // basic property
    this.last_name = last_name; 

    this.hello = function(name) {   // method
        console.log('Hello, ', name);
    }
};

var dude = new Person('Steve', 'Smith');    // instantiating new object
console.log(dude);    // Person {first_name: "Steve", last_name: "Smith", hello: ƒ}
dude.hello("Matt");   // calling the method
```

  - that's a basic example of creating a "class" for the object, `Person`, with basic properties and a method.

[[↑] Back to top](#top)

### Using the example above, add a method or property to your** `Person` **object.

```js
Person.prototype.full_name = function() {
    console.log(this.first_name + ' ' + this.last_name);
}

Person.prototype.monopoly = {
    money: 1500,
    cards: []
}

dude.full_name();           // Steve Smith
console.log(dude.monopoly); // {money: 1500, cards: Array(0)}
```
  - notice how both are logged out. Despite not being instantiated with either the `full_name()` method or the `monopoly` property, the `dude` object has access to them.

### Demonstrate the concepts of Encapsulation in object-oriented JavaScript

- Here are some definitions of encapsulation:

> Encapsulation is about hiding information and implementation. Objects should expose only those properties and methods which are required by the outside world to interact with them. Everything else should be hidden.

> Encapsulation includes the idea that the data of an object should not be directly exposed.  Instead, callers that want to achieve a given result are coaxed into proper usage by invoking methods (rather than accessing the data directly).

- Here is an example that I believe demonstrates encapsulation in ES5:

```js
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;

    let species = "human";

    this.setSpecies = function(input) {
        species = input;
    }

    this.getSpecies = function() {
        console.log(species);
        return species;
    }
}

var person = new Person("Dave");
console.log(person);            // Person {name: "Dave", setSpecies: ƒ, getSpecies: ƒ}
console.log(person.species);    // undefined
person.getSpecies();            // human
person.setSpecies('alien');
person.getSpecies();            // alien
```

- In the above example, I am creating a new `Person` object called `person` and it has a property of "Dave"
- The `species` variable cannot be accessed outside of `Person` so it is "private"
- Using the `setSpecies()` and `getSpecies()` methods on the `Person` object, I can set and get the value of the `species` variable
- `person.getSpecies();` returns "human"
- `person.setSpecies();` changes the species to "alien"
- `person.getSpecies();` returns "alien"
- The above example work essentially because of closures. The inner functions `setSpecies` and `getSpecies`
- It appears that creating encapsulation using Classes from ES6 is a little more difficult but there are a number of options like:
    + WeakMaps
    + Symbols
    + Getters

### Explain how prototypal inheritance works

- Prototypal inheritance and JavaScript Objects generally don't feel incredibly difficult but explaining *prototypes* in a succinct way is a bit tricky. I've read a lot of definitions that feel the need to address the fact that JavaScript classes don't *really* inherit methods the way other programming languages with classes do. The following "definition" is really just a list of important points relating to prototypes and then some code that explains it.
- All JavaScript objects have a prototype property that is a reference to another object.
- When you ask for a property or method on an object, if it's not there, JavaScript will traverse (go up) the prototype chain and try to find that property or method on the linked object. If it isn't there, it traverses again up the prototype chain looking for that property/method.
- This will keep happening until it finds the property/method OR it runs out of objects to traverse.
- This link explains more of the computer science answer as to why "prototypal inheritance" doesn't quite apply to JavaScript if you use the word "inheritance" as it's intended from classical languages: [Quora: What is Prototypal Inheritance](https://www.quora.com/What-is-prototypal-inheritance/answer/Kyle-Simpson)
- Here is another good link from Kyle Simpson's **You Don't Know JS**: [Chapter 5: Prototypes](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch5.md#chapter-5-prototypes)

## Hard

### What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?

- Here are a number of different definitions for closures from a number of different sources:

[coolinmc6/advanced_javascript](https://github.com/coolinmc6/advanced_javascript#lecture-12-what-are-function-closures)

> A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables—scope chain. 
The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its 
curly brackets), it has access to the outer function's variables, and it has access to the global variables.

[FreeCodeCamp (Medium)](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-closures-simplified-d0d23fa06ba4)

> A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables — a scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: (1) it has access to its own scope — variables defined between its curly brackets, (2) it has access to the outer function’s variables, (3) it has access to the global variables

[MDN: Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

> A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. 

[JavaScript is Sexy: Understand JavaScript Closures With Ease](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-with-ease/)

> A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables—scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function’s variables, and it has access to the global variables.
> The inner function has access not only to the outer function’s variables, but also to the outer function’s parameters. Note that the inner function cannot call the outer function’s arguments object, however, even though it can call the outer function’s parameters directly.

[FEIH: JavaScript](https://github.com/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook/blob/master/questions/javascript-questions.md#what-is-a-closure-and-howwhy-would-you-use-one)

> Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables—scope chain even after the outer function has returned.

- Those definitions alone are hard to visualize. Here is a super simple example with code:

```js
var c = 13;
function outer() {
    var b = 10;
    var d = 9;
    function inner() {
        var a = 6;
        console.log(a+b+c);
    }
    return inner;
}

var X = outer();
X();
```

- in the above example, it's easy to see that the only thing that really "happens" is that the inner function (conveniently called `inner()`) simply logs the sum of three variables: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- The function `outer()` returns the function `inner()` so when I  `var X = outer()`, I'm not executing the function. 
- I execute it on the next line `X()`. When I do that, I get 29 in the console, showing essentially what the definition of a closure says that it does: it has access to the following scope chains:
	+ the `inner` function's own scope: `a`
	+ the `outer` function's variables that **it have been enclosed in inner**: `b`
		* *Note*: I won't have access to the variable `d` because it has NOT been enclosed in the `inner()` function
	+ the global scope's variable: `c`
- Wrapping that all up, when I execute `X()`, I am running the `inner` function which, because of closures, has access to all those variables and I can show `29` in the console.
- So that's a good example of closures that I can recreate whenever I want. If someone asks to demonstrate a simple example of closures, do the above example.
- Here is the above example extended to show a simple example of how the values of the outer function can "carry" into the inner function:

```js
var c = 13;
function outer() {
    var b = 10;
    function inner() {
        var a = 6;
        console.log('Total: ', a+b+c);
        console.log('a = ', a, ' b = ', b);
        a++;
        b++;
    }
    return inner;
}

var X = outer();
X();
X();
X();
X();
/*
* Console Output
*
* Total:  29
* a =  6  b =  10
* Total:  30
* a =  6  b =  11
* Total:  31
* a =  6  b =  12
* Total:  32
* a =  6  b =  13
* 
*/
```

- notice how incrementing `a` does nothing because I am setting it within the `inner` function to 6
- `c` never changes
- and `b` is being incrememnted so that with each call ( `X()` ), the value of `b` is carried over and so it goes from `6 + 10 + 13` to `6 + 11 + 13` to `6 + 12 + 13`, etc.

### Closures - What will be the output of the following code:

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() { console.log(i); }, i * 1000 );
}
```
**Explain your answer. How could the use of closures help here?**

- The number 5 is printed 5 times
- I've seen this type of closure question before. Here is how you can solve it:

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    (function(i) {
        setTimeout(function() { console.log(i); }, i * 1000 );     
    })(i)
   
}
```

- First, why does it NOT work? As I've seen from other questions, the `setTimeout()` functions will not get executed until after the `for` loop is done. This means that when it is done, each execution will reference the last value of `i`, which will be 5.
- So how do we fix this? We can fix this with closures to create a unique scope for each iteration and storing the value of the `i` variable we want within its scope.
- By wrapping the `setTimeout` in an IIFE and passing `i` to the IIFE as opposed to directly to to the `setTimeout`, I can enclose each value of `i` in the closure so that particular value is logged and attached to the function.
- We can also solve this using ES6 syntax and using `let` as opposed to `var`. As a reminder, `let` and `const` have block-level scope while `var` has function level scope.

### Can you give an example of a curry function and why this syntax offers an advantage?

> Currying is when you break down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that take part of the arguments.

- Here is a super simple example:

```js
function curriedFn(a) {
    return function(b) {
        return a * b;
    }
}

var multiplyBy3 = curriedFn(3);
var twelve = multiplyBy3(4);
console.log(twelve);            // 12
```

- When do you use currying? 
- Show a more advanced example of currying.
- Be able to explain currying.

## Intermediate

### Can you name two programming paradigms important for JavaScript app developers?

> JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting imperative/procedural programming along with OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and functional programming. JavaScript supports OOP with prototypal inheritance.



[[↑] Back to top](#top)


### What is functional programming?

> Functional programming produces programs by composing mathematical functions and avoids shared state & mutable data.

- Functional programming has pure functions:
    + no side-effects
    + same input returns the same output every time



### How do you organize your code? (module pattern, classical inheritance?) Explain the Module Pattern. Explain Classical Inheritance.

- Here is an example of the Module Pattern:

```js
var Module = (function() {
    function privateMethod() {
        // do something
    }

    return {
        publicMethod: function() {
            // can call privateMethod();
        }
    };
})();

Module.publicMethod(); // works
Module.privateMethod(); // Uncaught ReferenceError: privateMethod is not defined
```

### Discuss possible ways to write a function `isInteger(x)` that determines if `x` is an integer.

```js
// ES6 solution pretty much already does this:
Number.isInteger()

// ES5 Solutions:

// bitwise XOR operator:
function isInteger(x) {
    return (x ^ 0) === x;
}

// This rounds down (or up; Math.ceil() works as well)
function isInteger(x) {
    return Math.floor(x) === x;
}

// Must check that it is a number
function isInteger(x) {
    return (typeof x === 'number') && (x % 1 === 0);
}

//============================================
// INCORRECT SOLUTIONS 
// This fails BECAUSE "false" would be classified as an integer:
function isInteger(x) {
    return (x % 1 === 0);
}

// This fails when x becomes really large due to how parseInt() converts scientific notation
function isInteger(x) { 
    return parseInt(x, 10) === x; 
}

### In what order will the numbers 1-4 be logged to the console when the code below is executed? Why?

```js
(function() {
    console.log(1); 
    setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000); 
    setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0); 
    console.log(4);
})();
```

- The answer is: 1, 4, 3, 2
- 1 and 4 are displayed first because they're simple `console.log()` calls
- 3 is logged next because it has only a 0 millisecond delay
- 2 is logged last because of 1 second delay
- Understanding the above is connected to the call stack and event table and event queue.
- `setTimeout()` puts its execution of its referenced function into the event queue if the browser is busy. This example below illustrates exactly this:

```js
for(let i = 0; i < 3000; i++) {
    if(i % 2 == 0) {
        setTimeout(function() {
            console.log(i)
        }, 0)
    } else {
        console.log(i)
    }
}
```

- even though there is a `setTimeout()` with 0 seconds delayed, **NONE** of the even numbers are logged to the console until **every** odd number is. I went as high as 3000 to show that this is not just a matter of there being too few logs between 1 and 4 as shown above. In my example, every single odd number is logged *before* any of the even numbers

### Write a `sum` method which will work properly when invoked using either syntax below.

```js
console.log(sum(2,3));   // Outputs 5
console.log(sum(2)(3));  // Outputs 5
```

- Completing this question required an understanding of the `arguments` parameter in functions. I've learned this before but have not just it very frequently. Here is one way to solve the problem:

```js
// Method #1
function sum(x) {
    if(arguments.length == 2) {
        return arguments[0] + arguments[1]
    } else {
        return function(y) {
            return x + y
        }
    }
}
```

- simply use the `arguments` parameter to count how many arguments you actually received. If you received two, just return the sum of those numbers; if you received 1, return a function that takes one argument and returns the sum of those two numbers
- The next method requires two arguments at the outset and checks if `y` is undefined. 

```js
function sum(x, y) {
  if (y !== undefined) {
    return x + y;
  } else {
    return function(y) { 
        return x + y; 
    }
  }
}
```

### This - Testing your `this` knowledge in JavaScript: What is the output of the following code?

```js
var length = 10;
function fn() {
	console.log(this.length);
}

var obj = {
  length: 5,
  method: function(fn) {
    fn();
    arguments[0]();
  }
};

obj.method(fn, 1);
```

- Answer: 10 2
- Everything starts at the bottom: `obj.method(fn, 1)`. The function `method` takes only argument, a function, but in this example we give it two...
- Inside `method`, we see only two lines: `fn()` and `arguments[0]()`. The first is pretty easy; it's just calling the function, `fn`, which was defined above. The second is trickier but that is really just the `arguments` array that comes with every function and it is just calling `fn()` again. So we get two `fn()` calls.
- So we have two function calls of `fn` but this is where it gets tricky. In the `fn()` function declaration, it simply logs `this.length` which, at its first call, `this` is the global `window` object. And because the first line, `var length = 10`, is declared on the global scope, `this.length` is equal to 10.
- The first log is 10
- For the second log, even though we are just calling `fn()` again, inside the `fn`, the scope of this function becomes the arguments arraw, and logging the length of `arguments[]` will return 2.
- CM - I need to run through a few more `this` examples, I don't think I entirely get this. I can recreate it

### The Rules of `this`

1 - If the `new` keyword is used when calling the function, `this` inside the function is a brand new object created by the JavaScript engine.

```js
function ConstructorExample() {
    console.log(this);
    this.value = 10;
    console.log(this);
}

new ConstructorExample();

// -> ConstructorExample {}
// -> ConstructorExample { value: 10 }
```

2 - If `apply`, `call`, or `bind` are used to call a function, `this` inside the function is the object that is passed in as the argument.

```js
function fn() {
    console.log(this);
}

var obj = {
    value: 5
};

var boundFn = fn.bind(obj);

boundFn(); // -> { value: 5 }
fn.call(obj); // -> { value: 5 }
fn.apply(obj); // -> { value: 5 }
```

3 - If a function is called as a method — that is, if dot notation is used to invoke the function — `this` is the object that the function is a property of. In other words, when a dot is to the left of a function invocation, `this` is the object to the left of the dot. (`ƒ` symbolizes function in the code blocks)

```js
const obj = {
    value: 5,
    printThis: function() {
      console.log(this);
    }
};

obj.printThis(); // -> { value: 5, printThis: ƒ }
```

4 - If a function is invoked as a free function invocation, meaning it was invoked without any of the conditions present above, `this` is the global object. In a browser, it’s `window`.

```js
function fn() {
    console.log(this);
}

// if called in browser:
fn(); // -> Window {stop: ƒ, open: ƒ, alert: ƒ, ...}
```

### Explain "hoisting".

- A simple definition of *hoisting* is the declaration of functions and variables "moved" to the top of the current scope.
- Your code isn't magically being moved to the top - what's actualy happening is that your declarations are added to memory during the compile phase.
- Here are some examples to show how it applies to variables and functions and some take-aways to remember:

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 5;
console.log(a); // 5

console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined
```

- There are a few things to notice here:
    + first, I am logging the value of `a` right away and I get `undefined`. This right here is **hoisting** in action. It gets `undefined` because I declared `a` in the second line (`var a = 5`)
    + Skipping to the bottom, notice how `b`, which is never declared, does NOT get the same `undefined`, it gets a ReferenceError. There was no `b` declaration to hoist therefore JavaScript has no idea what the hell `b` is
    + On line 2 I define `a` and then print out its value on line 3. Nothing controversial there; that's normal behavior.
    + The key thing to notice is the difference between what happens on line 1 (`undefined` is logged) because `a` has been declared SOMEWHERE in the code and what happens on line 5 (`ReferenceError`) because `b` was never declared.
- That's the first example: simple `var` declarations. A take-away here is that **only declarations are hoisted**, not *initializations*. 
- Sticking with variables, the next example shows how hoisting only applies to variables declared with `var`:

```js
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: a is not defined
let a = 5;
console.log(a); // [NEVER EXECUTED]: because of the error, this is never run
```

```js
console.log(a); // ReferenceError: a is not defined
const a = 5;
console.log(a); // [NEVER EXECUTED]: because of the error, this is never run
```

- In these two examples, we are using the `let` and `const` keywords as opposed to `var`. 
- The key take-away here is that they cannot be hoisted! 
    + `var`: Yes, it is hoisted
    + `let`: NO, it is **not** hoisted
    + `const`: NO, it is **not** hoisted
- Moving onto functions:

```js
sayHello('Colin');  // Hello, Colin
function sayHello(name) {
    console.log('Hello, ', name);
}
sayHello('Colin');  // Hello, Colin
```

- Notice that it works both times! I call `sayHello()` on line 1 despite declaring in line 2 and it still works!
- The Line 5 call of `sayHello()` also works as expected
- As a quick sidenote, the way I've declared `sayHello` above is called a *function declaration*. It uses the function keyword and then name of the argument. In the above example, `sayHello` was hoisted. The same does not apply to *function expressions* like below:

```js
sayHello('Colin');  // TypeError: sayHello is not a function
var sayHello = function(name) {
    console.log('Hello, ', name);
}
sayHello('Colin');
```

- Notice how I get a `TypeError` - it has no idea what `sayHello` is.
- Here is a quick table about hoisting:

|Type|Code|Hoisted?|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Variable|`var` declaration|**Yes**|
|Variable|`let` declaration|No|
|Variable|`const` declaration|No|
|Function|Function declaration<br>`function sayHello(){}`|**Yes**|
|Function|Function expression<br>`var sayHello = function(){}`|No|

### Hoisting - What will be the output of this code?

```js
var x = 21;
var girl = function () {
    console.log(x);
    var x = 20;
};
girl ();
```

- Neither 21 nor 20, the result is `undefined`
- I would've initially thought 21 but what is really happening is related to hoisting. So first, it's not 21 because when the function is executed, it sees that there is a local `x` variable present.
- So 21 is NOT used because there's a local `x`
- Hoisting in JavaScript means that variable declarations (`var x;`) are hoisted but NOT initializations `var x = 20`. So in this scenario, the `x` that it's looking for will be `var x = 20` but that initial value isn't given until after the console.log.

### Object Equality - How would you compare two objects in JavaScript?

- Answering this question completely requires an understanding of how JavaScript tests for equality. Primitives (undefined, null, boolean, string, and number) are compared by their value while Objects (which includes objects (e.g. user-defined objects), arrays, dates) are compared by reference.
- Comparing "by reference" pretty much means assessing whether these two objects are pointing to the same location in memory.
- So to check two objects that do not point to the same location in memory, we need to check whether the objects have the same properties and same values in those properties. If all the properties have the same value, they are equal.
- Here are two solutions:

```js
function isEqual(a, b) {
    var aProps = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(a),
        bProps = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(b);

    if (aProps.length != bProps.length) {
        return false;
    }

    for (var i = 0; i < aProps.length; i++) {
        var propName = aProps[i];
        
        if (a[propName] !== b[propName]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

- The solution I came up with is not 100% correct because it uses `Object.keys()` which is not the same as `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()`. Here is a good explanation of the difference between them: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22658488/object-getownpropertynames-vs-object-keys](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22658488/object-getownpropertynames-vs-object-keys)
    + the short answer is that `Object.keys()` returns all *enumerable* own properties on the object. So if you manually set a property to `{enumerable: false}`, then `Object.keys()` won't have that property in the resulting array.
    + I have never manually made a property not enumerable but just FYI

### What is JSONP? How does it work and how is it different than AJAX?

- JSONP (JSON with Padding) is a method commonly used to bypass the cross-domain policies in web browsers because Ajax requests from the current page to a cross-origin domain is not allowed.
- JSONP works by making a request to a cross-origin domain via a `<script>` tag and usually with a callback query parameter, for example: `https://example.com?callback=printData1`. The server will then wrap the data within a function called `printData` and return it to the client.

```html
<!-- https://mydomain.com -->
<script>
function printData(data) {
  console.log(`My name is ${data.name}!`);
}
</script>

<script src="https://example.com?callback=printData"></script>
```

```js
// File loaded from https://example.com?callback=printData
printData({ name: 'Yang Shun' });
```

- The client has to have the `printData` function in its global scope and the function will be executed by the client when the response from the cross-origin domain is received.
- JSONP can be unsafe and has some security implications. As JSONP is really JavaScript, it can do everything else JavaScript can do, so you need to trust the provider of the JSONP data.
- These days, [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) is the recommended approach and JSONP is seen as a hack.

### Describe event bubbling.

> When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors. The process is called “bubbling”, because events “bubble” from the inner element up through parents like a bubble in the water.

- This means the event checks for a handler on **each** parent ancestor as it goes up the chain. So your event handler on the child it will check for that same event on the parent element. This CodePen shows that in code: [CodePen: Event Bubbling](https://codepen.io/coolinmc6/full/GzxOjz)
  - There are two elements: a `div.child` and `div.parent`; the child is inside the parent
  - THere are click handlers on both the child and parent to console.log something when clicked
  - If you click on the `.child`, you get two logs: one from the child and then one from the parent (because there are two event handlers)
  If you click on the `.parent`, you get only one log => **events bubbles UP from child -> parent -> all the way up to the `document` element**

### What is a Promise? How does a Promise work?

> A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. It is a placeholder into which the successful result value or reason for failure will materialize.

> A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that it’s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.

### What language constructions do you use for iterating over object properties and array items?

**For objects:**

* `for-in` loops - `for (var property in obj) { console.log(property); }`. However, this will also iterate through its inherited properties, and you will add an `obj.hasOwnProperty(property)` check before using it.
* `Object.keys()` - `Object.keys(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... })`. `Object.keys()` is a static method that will lists all enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.
* `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` - `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... })`. `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` is a static method that lists all enumerable and non-enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.

**For arrays:**

* `for` loops - `for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)`. The common pitfall here is that `var` is in the function scope and not the block scope and most of the time you would want block scoped iterator variable. ES2015 introduces `let` which has block scope and it is recommended to use that instead. So this becomes: `for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)`.
* `forEach` - `arr.forEach(function (el, index) { ... })`. This construct can be more convenient at times because you do not have to use the `index` if all you need is the array elements. There are also the `every` and `some` methods which will allow you to terminate the iteration early.
* `for-of` loops - `for (let elem of arr) { ... }`. ES6 introduces a new loop, the `for-of` loop, that allows you to loop over objects that conform to the [iterable protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterable_protocol) such as `String`, `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, etc. It combines the advantages of the `for` loop and the `forEach()` method. The advantage of the `for` loop is that you can break from it, and the advantage of `forEach()` is that it is more concise than the `for` loop because you don't need a counter variable. With the `for-of` loop, you get both the ability to break from a loop and a more concise syntax. 

- Also, when using the `for-of` loop, if you need to access both the index and value of each array element, you can do so with the ES6 Array `entries()` method and destructuring:

```
const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

for (let [index, elem] of arr.entries()) { 
  console.log(index, ': ', elem);
}
```

### Explain the difference between mutable and immutable objects.

- The difference between these things are essentially in the definition: *mutable objects* can be changed after instantiation/creation while *immutable objects* cannot.

> A mutable object is an object whose state can be modified after it is created. An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.

- Immutable objects are used in functional programming, especially React and Redux. In Redux, when you update state, you are essentially creating a new object with the updated value as opposed to changing the first object.
- Using the `const` keyword will NOT make an array or object immutable. It does, however, make *primitive values* like `String` and `Number` variables unchangeable. See below:

```js
const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];    // ['a', 'b', 'c']
arr.push('d');                  // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
arr.shift();                    // ['b', 'c', 'd']

const apple = "apple";          // "apple"
apple = "orange";               // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```
- the `arr` variable can be added to, removed from, and even changed with index assignment `arr[0] = 'e'`. The `String` variable `apple` cannot be changed or re-assigned.

### Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions.

- Synchronous functions are blocking while asynchronous functions are not. In synchronous functions, statements complete before the next statement is run. In this case, the program is evaluated exactly in order of the statements and execution of the program is paused if one of the statements take a very long time.
- Asynchronous functions usually accept a callback as a parameter and execution continues on the next line immediately after the asynchronous function is invoked. The callback is only invoked when the asynchronous operation is complete and the call stack is empty. Heavy duty operations such as loading data from a web server or querying a database should be done asynchronously so that the main thread can continue executing other operations instead of blocking until that long operation to complete (in the case of browsers, the UI will freeze).
- A `Promise` is used to handle asynchronous code. It allows you to make asynchronous code look synchronous
- JavaScript is a single-threaded language

[[↑] Back to top](#top)

### What is asynchronous programming, and why is it important in JavaScript?

- On synchronous programming:

> Synchronous programming means that, barring conditionals and function calls, code is executed sequentially from top-to-bottom, blocking on long-running tasks such as network requests and disk I/O.

- vs. asynchronous:

> Asynchronous programming means that the engine runs in an event loop. When a blocking operation is needed, the request is started, and the code keeps running without blocking for the result. When the response is ready, an interrupt is fired, which causes an event handler to be run, where the control flow continues. In this way, a single program thread can handle many concurrent operations.

### What is the event loop? What is the difference between call stack and task queue?

> The event loop is a single-threaded loop that monitors the call stack and checks if there is any work to be done in the task queue. If the call stack is empty and there are callback functions in the task queue, a function is dequeued and pushed onto the call stack to be executed.

- To understand the event loop, you need to understand what the call stack is. JavaScript has a single call stack in which it keeps track of what function we’re currently executing and what function is to be executed after that.
  - when you see `stack`, think like the data structure; it is LIFO or FILO. Like a stack of plates, the plate on top is the first one removed
- Every time you call a setTimeout function or you do some async operation — it is added to the Event Table. 
- The Event Table does not execute functions and does not add them to the call stack on it’s own. It’s sole purpose is to keep track of events and send them to the Event Queue.
- The Event Queue is a data structure similar to the stack — again you add items to the back but can only remove them from the front. It kind of stores the correct order in which the functions should be executed. It receives the function calls from the Event Table, but it needs to somehow send them to the Call Stack.
- The event loop is constantly checking if the call stack is empty. If it is empty, it looks at the Event Queue. If there is something in the event queue that is waiting it is moved to the call stack. If not, then nothing happens.

### Explain the differences on the usage of `foo` between `function foo() {}` and `var foo = function() {}`.

- `function foo() {}` is a *function declaration* while `var foo = function() {}` is a function expression. 
- The key difference is that a function declaration has its body hoisted but the body of a function expression is not (they have the same hoisting behavior as variables).

**Function Declaration**

```js
foo(); // 'FOOOOO'
function foo() {
  console.log('FOOOOO');
}
```

**Function Expression**

```js
foo(); // Uncaught TypeError: foo is not a function
var foo = function() {
  console.log('FOOOOO');
};

// Similar to variables:
console.log(a);     // undefined
var a = 'hey there!';
```

### ES6 Template Literals offer a lot of flexibility in generating strings, can you give an example?

- The main uses are simply *string interpolation* and *multi-line strings*. 
- Template literals help make it simple to do string interpolation, or to include variables in a string. Before ES2015, it was common to do something like this:

```js
var person = { name: 'Colin', age: 12 };
console.log('Hi, my name is ' + person.name + ' and I am ' + person.age + ' years old!');
// 'Hi, my name is Colin and I am 12 years old!'
```

- With template literals, you can now create that same output like this instead:

```js
const person = { name: 'Colin', age: 12 };
console.log(`Hi, my name is ${person.name} and I am ${person.age} years old!`);
// 'Hi, my name is Colin and I am 12 years old!'
```

- Note that you use backticks, not quotes, to indicate that you are using a template literal and that you can insert expressions inside the `${}` placeholders.
- A second helpful use case is in creating multi-line strings. Before ES2015, you could create a multi-line string like this:

```js
console.log('This is line one.\nThis is line two.');
// This is line one.
// This is line two.
```

- Or if you wanted to break it up into multiple lines in your code so you didn't have to scroll to the right in your text editor to read a long string, you could also write it like this:

```js
console.log('This is line one.\n' +
	'This is line two.');
// This is line one.
// This is line two.
```

- Template literals, however, preserve whatever spacing you add to them. For example, to create that same multi-line output that we created above, you can simply do:

```js
console.log(`This is line one.
This is line two.`);
// This is line one.
// This is line two.
```

### What are the differences between variables created using let, var or const?

- Variables declared using the `var` keyword are scoped to the function in which they are created, or if created outside of any function, to the global object. `let` and `const` are _block scoped_, meaning they are only accessible within the nearest set of curly braces (function, if-else block, or for-loop).
- This first example shows how inside the function, we can log them to the console, but outside of `foo()`, none of them are defined. *Nothing too crazy or exciting here...this makes sense.*

```js
function foo() {
  // All variables are accessible within functions.
  var bar = 'bar';
  let baz = 'baz';
  const qux = 'qux';

  console.log(bar); // bar
  console.log(baz); // baz
  console.log(qux); // qux
}

console.log(bar); // ReferenceError: bar is not defined
console.log(baz); // ReferenceError: baz is not defined
console.log(qux); // ReferenceError: qux is not defined
```

- This next snippet really shows the difference between `var` and `let` / `const`:

```js
if (true) {
  var bar = 'bar';
  let baz = 'baz';
  const qux = 'qux';
}

// var declared variables are accessible anywhere in the function scope.
console.log(bar); // bar
// let and const defined variables are not accessible outside of the block they were defined in.
console.log(baz); // ReferenceError: baz is not defined
console.log(qux); // ReferenceError: qux is not defined
```

- `var` allows variables to be hoisted, meaning they can be referenced in code before they are declared. 
- `let` and `const` will not allow this, instead throwing an error.

```js
console.log(foo); // undefined

var foo = 'foo';

console.log(baz); // ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'baz' before initialization

let baz = 'baz';

console.log(bar); // ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'bar' before initialization

const bar = 'bar';
```

- Redeclaring a variable with `var` will not throw an error, but 'let' and 'const' will.

```js
var foo = 'foo';
var foo = 'bar';
console.log(foo); // "bar"

let baz = 'baz';
let baz = 'qux'; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'baz' has already been declared
```

- `let` and `const` differ in that `let` allows reassigning the variable's value while `const` does not.

```js
// This is fine.
let foo = 'foo';
foo = 'bar';

// This causes an exception.
const baz = 'baz';
baz = 'qux';            // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

### What are the differences between ES6 class and ES5 function constructors?

Let's first look at example of each:

```js
// ES5 Function Constructor
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// ES6 Class
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

- For simple constructors, they look pretty similar.
- The main difference in the constructor comes when using inheritance. If we want to create a `Student` class that subclasses `Person` and add a `studentId` field, this is what we have to do in addition to the above.

```js
// ES5 Function Constructor
function Student(name, studentId) {
  // Call constructor of superclass to initialize superclass-derived members.
  Person.call(this, name);

  // Initialize subclass's own members.
  this.studentId = studentId;
}

// if I don't add this, the __proto__ of my new student is Object, and I want it to be Person
Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype); 
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;

// ES6 Class
class Student extends Person {
  constructor(name, studentId) {
    super(name);
    this.studentId = studentId;
  }
}
```

- It's much more verbose to use inheritance in ES5 and the ES6 version is easier to understand and remember.

### What's the difference between an "attribute" and a "property"?

> When writing HTML source code, you can define attributes on your HTML elements. Then, once the browser parses your code, a corresponding DOM node will be created. This node is an object, and therefore it has properties.

- the above definition is pretty easy to understand. *Attributes* are in HTML and can be defined in the HTML elements. *Properties* are just like the properties on an object - and that's what it is: the browser parses the code and a corresponding DOM node is created. This node is an object that has properties.

### Can you offer a use case for the new arrow => function syntax? How does this new syntax differ from other functions?

- One obvious benefit of arrow functions is to simplify the syntax needed to create functions, without a need for the `function` keyword. 
- The `this` within arrow functions is also bound to the enclosing scope which is different compared to regular functions where the `this` is determined by the object calling it. 
- Lexically-scoped `this` is useful when invoking callbacks especially in React components.
- Lexical Scoping just means that it uses `this` from the code that contains the Arrow Function.

### What is the definition of a higher-order function?

- A higher-order function is any function that takes one or more functions as arguments, which it uses to operate on some data, and/or returns a function as a result. 
- Higher-order functions are meant to abstract some operation that is performed repeatedly. The classic example of this is `map`, which takes an array and a function as arguments. `map` then uses this function to transform each item in the array, returning a new array with the transformed data. 
- Other popular examples in JavaScript are `forEach`, `filter`, and `reduce`. A higher-order function doesn't just need to be manipulating arrays as there are many use cases for returning a function from another function. `Function.prototype.bind` is one such example in JavaScript.

### Can you give an example for destructuring an object or an array?

- Destructuring is an expression available in ES6 which enables a succinct and convenient way to extract values of Objects or Arrays and place them into distinct variables.

**Array destructuring**

```js
// Variable assignment.
const foo = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

const [one, two, three] = foo;
console.log(one); // "one"
console.log(two); // "two"
console.log(three); // "three"
```

```js
// Swapping variables
let a = 1;
let b = 3;

[a, b] = [b, a];
console.log(a); // 3
console.log(b); // 1
```

**Object destructuring**

```js
// Variable assignment.
const o = { p: 42, q: true };
const { p, q } = o;

console.log(p); // 42
console.log(q); // true

var person = {
    name: "Colin", 
    age: 12
}

const { age, name } = person;
console.log(name) // Colin
console.log(age);  // 12
```

### What's the difference between a variable that is: `null`, `undefined` or undeclared? How would you go about checking for any of these states?

- **Undeclared** variables are created when you assign a value to an identifier that is not previously created using `var`, `let` or `const`. 
- Undeclared variables will be defined globally, outside of the current scope. In strict mode, a `ReferenceError` will be thrown when you try to assign to an undeclared variable. 
- Undeclared variables are bad just like how global variables are bad. Avoid them at all cost! To check for them, wrap its usage in a `try`/`catch` block.

```js
function foo() {
  x = 1; // Throws a ReferenceError in strict mode
}

foo();
console.log(x); // 1
```

- A *variable* that is `undefined` is a variable that has been declared, but not assigned a value. It is of type `undefined`. 
- If a *function* does not return any value as the result of executing it is assigned to a variable, the variable also has the value of `undefined`. 
- To check for it, compare using the strict equality (`===`) operator or `typeof` which will give the `'undefined'` string. 
  - Don't use `(x == 'undefined')` as it will also return `true` if the value is `null`.

```js
var foo;
console.log(foo); // undefined
console.log(foo === undefined); // true
console.log(typeof foo === 'undefined'); // true

console.log(foo == null); // true. This is Wrong! You need the strict equality operator

function bar() {}
var baz = bar();
console.log(baz); // undefined
```

- A variable that is `null` will have been explicitly assigned to the `null` value. It represents no value and is different from `undefined` in the sense that it has been explicitly assigned. 
- To check for `null,` simply compare using the strict equality operator. 
- Just like `undefined` above, you should not be using the abstract equality operator (`==`) to check, as it will also return `true` if the value is `undefined`.

```js
var foo = null;
console.log(foo === null); // true
console.log(typeof foo === 'object'); // true

console.log(foo == undefined); // true. Wrong, don't use this to check!
```

### What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?

- Here are the big three:
  - IIFEs (wrap the function and call it right away)
  - Callback that is used once and doesn't need to be used anywhere else( e.g. jQuery)
  - Arguments to functional programming constructrs or Lodash
- They can be used in IIFEs to encapsulate some code within a local scope so that variables declared in it do not leak to the global scope.

```js
(function() {
  // Some code here.
})();
```

- As a callback that is used once and does not need to be used anywhere else. The code will seem more self-contained and readable when handlers are defined right inside the code calling them, rather than having to search elsewhere to find the function body.

```js
// 
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('Hello world!');
}, 1000);

// jQuery example
$('.delete-btn').on('click', function() {
    alert("Delete!!");
})
```

- Arguments to functional programming constructs or Lodash (similar to callbacks).
  - functional programming items like `map`, `filter`, etc.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const double = arr.map(function(el) {
  return el * 2;
});
console.log(double); // [2, 4, 6]
```

### What's the difference between host objects and native objects?

- Native objects are objects that are part of the JavaScript language defined by the ECMAScript specification, such as `String`, `Math`, `RegExp`, `Object`, `Function`, etc.
- Host objects are provided by the runtime environment (browser or Node), such as `window`, `XMLHTTPRequest`, etc.

### What is "use strict" and what does it do?

- `"use strict"` is used to enable strict mode to an entire script (e.g. place at top of page) or individual functions. Strict mode is a way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript.
- Here are some of the main features / benefits:
	+ it makes debugging easier
	+ prevents you from accidentally creating global variables
	+ prevents you from naming variables that will be keywords in future JS verisons
	+ doesn't let you delete arguments to functions, functions, or variables

```js
// "use strict";

// not Strict mode
function newCode() {
    "use strict";

    // Strict Mode
}

// this would not be allowed as it was never defined anywhere with "var asim ="
asim = 1;

var theVal = 0;

thVal = 1;

if(theVal > 0) {
    console.log('hello')
}

// with eval and no "use strict", a can "leak out"
eval("var a = 1");
console.log(a);
```

**Advantages:**

* Makes it impossible to accidentally create global variables.
* Makes assignments which would otherwise silently fail to throw an exception.
* Makes attempts to delete undeletable properties throw (where before the attempt would simply have no effect).
* Requires that function parameter names be unique.
* `this` is undefined in the global context.
* It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.
* It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.

**Disadvantages:**

* Many missing features that some developers might be used to.
* No more access to `function.caller` and `function.arguments`.
* Concatenation of scripts written in different strict modes might cause issues.
