# Higher Order Components (HOCs)

- Higher Order Component definition from React docs:

> A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. 
> HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from React’s compositional nature.

- HOC's often have some descriptor in their name. For example, `withAuth()` suggests
that the component passed will receive the `withAuth()` props and, presumably, require
authentication for users to view.

```js
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
```
