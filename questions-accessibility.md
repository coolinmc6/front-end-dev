# Accessibility Questions

- The source for most of these questions is [https://github.com/scottaohara/accessibility_interview_questions](https://github.com/scottaohara/accessibility_interview_questions).

## Sources

- [MDN: Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility)
    + 

## General

### What are some overall recommendations to increase your website's accessibility:

- Website-specifics:
    + pages are consistent — navigation, header, footer, and main content are always in the same places.
    + tools are well-designed and easy to use.
    + multi-stage processes are broken down into logical steps, with regular reminders of how far through the process you are, and how long you've got left to complete the process, if appropriate.
    + workflows are logical, simple, and require as few interactions as possible to complete. For example, registering and signing in to a website is often unneccessarily complex.
    + pages are not overly long or dense in terms of the amount of information presented at once.
    + the language used in your pages is as plain and easy to follow as possible, and not full of unneccessary jargon and slang.
    + important points and content are highlighted in some way.
    user errors are clearly highlighted, with help messages to suggest solutions.
- Consider accessibility from the start of your project instead of trying to retrofit your website
- Publish an accessibility statement on your site that details what your policy is toward accessibility

### What is WCAG and where can you learn about some of the accessibility requirements?

- WCAG stands for **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines**.
- There are two major sources:
    + [WCAG Guidelines (Comprehensive)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
    + [WCAG At a Glance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/)
    + [WCAG 2 Quick Reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)
- WCAG appears to have four major principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust.
- **Perceivable**
    + Provide text alternatives  for non-text content.
    + Provide captions and other alternatives  for multimedia.
    + Create content that can be presented in different ways, including by assistive technologies, without losing meaning.
    + Make it easier for users to see and hear content.
- **Operable**
    + Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
    + Give users enough time  to read and use content.
    + Do not use content that causes seizures  or physical reactions.
    + Help users navigate and find content.
    + Make it easier to use inputs other than keyboard.
- **Understandable**
    + Make text readable and understandable.
    + Make content appear and operate in predictable ways.
    + Help users avoid and correct mistakes.
- **Robust**
    + Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools.
