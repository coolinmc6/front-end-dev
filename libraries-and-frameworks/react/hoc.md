# Higher Order Components (HOCs)

- Higher Order Component definition from React docs:

> A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. 
> HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from Reactâ€™s compositional nature.

- HOC's often have some descriptor in their name. For example, `withAuth()` suggests
that the component passed will receive the `withAuth()` props and, presumably, require
authentication for users to view.

```js
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
```

### Authentication Higher Order Component

- In this example, we are going to look at how you could (theoretically) wrap a protected page
or some page that requires authorization/authentication. To do that we

```js
// withAuthentication.js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

const withAuthentication = (WrappedComponent) => {
  class HOC extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
    }
    
    componentDidMount() {
      if(!this.props.authenticated) {
        console.log("not logged in - you would be moved out")
      }
    }
    componentDidUpdate() {
      if(!this.props.authenticated) {
        console.log("not logged in - you would be moved out")
      }
    }
    render() {
      return (
        <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />
      )
    }
  }

  return HOC;
}

export default withAuthentication;
```
```js
// ProtectedPage.js
import React from 'react';

import withAuthentication from './withAuthentication';

const ProtectedPage = (props) => {
  const { authenticated, setAuth } = props;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Protected Page</h1>
      {authenticated ? (
        <div>
          
          <button onClick={() => setAuth(false)}>Logout</button>
          <br/>
          <h2>Protected Stuff</h2>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <div>
          You are not logged in.<br/>
          <button onClick={() => setAuth(true)}>Login</button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  )  
}

const WrappedComponent = withAuthentication(ProtectedPage)

export default WrappedComponent;
```

- **Authentication HOC**
  - In this example, there is an outer functional component called `withAuthentication` that takes
  a component that you want to have wrapped. In the parentheses, it is called `WrappedComponent`.
  - Inside the functional component, we create a new class-based component called `HOC`.
  - There are two lifecycle methods, `componentDidMount()` and `componentDidUpdate()`. In both
  of these, we look at the `authenticated` property of the component. Presumably, if `false`, 
  the user would be kicked off the page
  - In the `render` method, we are simply return the Wrapped Component with the props spread.
  - Lastly, we return the `HOC` component
- **ProtectedPage**
  - Notice that after importing the HOC, it is a pretty standard functional component
  - Near the bottom of the page, I create my `WrappedComponent`. Here is the code:
  `const WrappedComponent = withAuthentication(ProtectedPage)`. So I'm now wrapping my page in
  the authentication HOC.
- In my main page, I can then just use my ProtectedPage however I want. `<ProtectedPage setAuth={setAuth} authenticated={authenticated}/>`
