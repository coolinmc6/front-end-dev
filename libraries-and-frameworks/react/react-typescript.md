```tsx
const modalId = useRef<string | null>(null)
```
This code creates a new React hook called `modalId` that uses the `useRef` hook to create a mutable ref object. 
The ref is initialized with a null value, and its current value can be accessed using the `.current` property. 
The `<string | null>` type assertion specifies that the ref can either hold a string value or null.

In general, the `useRef` hook is used to create a mutable reference to a value that persists across renders. 
This can be useful for saving a reference to a DOM element or a value that needs to be accessed outside of the 
typical React component lifecycle. In this case, the `modalId` ref is likely being used to store the id of a 
modal component, which can then be accessed and manipulated elsewhere in the code.
