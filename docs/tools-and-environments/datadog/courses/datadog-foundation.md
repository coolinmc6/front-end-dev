# Datadog Foundation

Source: https://learn.datadoghq.com/courses/datadog-foundation

## Introduction

- Datadog is a SaaS platform that does three main things:
  - collect monitoring data that our technology / systems produce
  - put it all in one place
  - organize and present it well so that we can act on it (detect issues that may be
  coming, diagnose them, and ultimately resolve those issues faster)

## Universal Service Monitoring

- Universal Service Monitoring means you are looking at your services (e.g. `store-frontend`)
across all compute instances
> **Universal Service Monitoring (USM)** offers a view of service health metrics across your entire
> technology stack, without the need to instrument your code. Instead, it relies on the presence of a
> configured Datadog Agent and **Unified Service Tagging** to collect data about your existing services,
> which can then be viewed through the Service Catalog.

### USM Lab

- Docker and setup stuff...not a whole lot that I'll need to deal with yet. I had to switch
the schema to v2.2

## Logs

- Datadog log management just allows you to collect, process, etc. all the logs from your
various services
- Log Explorer is the main hub for this and then you filter in the search bar or with the
filtering tools
