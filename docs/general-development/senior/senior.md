- there were a lot of useful things but I think one of the more useful points was
**speed of execution**. Get your core work done quickly and then you have time for
growth.
- That "growth" doesn't just mean going off and learning whatever **you** feel
like learning but it means finding high value work that will deliver a big
impact.
- As a follow-up to speed is that completing something quickly is great but
if it is B+ code then who cares. Use the benefits of that fast execution to
really make the code great.
- With the extra time, you can also study how more senior developers solve 
problems. That can mean reading their PRs to understand their code but there is
more to it than that.
- Acting “above your level” isn’t about doing more tasks; it’s about developing
a broader viewpoint, understanding cross-team dependencies, making strategic
decisions, and sharing insights that help the whole organization.
- Here are some more tips to acting "above your level":

**1. Deep-Dive Architectural Reviews**
- **Join design discussions**: Attend architecture or system-design
  meetings—even if you’re not on the invite list—and ask questions
  afterward if you feel unsure.
- **Study existing architecture**: Review how major systems are laid out
  and why they’re designed that way. Look for trade-offs
  (performance vs. maintainability, etc.).
- **Propose improvements**: If you notice inefficiencies, suggest
  solutions. Even if they aren’t adopted right away, you’ll strengthen
  your higher-level thinking.

**2. Trace Problems Across Teams**
- **Map dependencies**: Understand which teams or systems rely on each
  other and why. This helps you see the broader impact of any change.
- **Identify pain points**: Watch for recurring issues (e.g., deployment
  bottlenecks). Coordinating fixes for these “nobody’s job” problems
  signals next-level ownership.

**3. Mentor & Teach**
- **Run informal sessions**: Offer “lunch-and-learn” talks on topics you
  know well. Teaching not only helps others but also clarifies your
  thinking.
- **Onboard new devs**: Volunteering to help new hires ramps up your
  cross-team relationships and reinforces your own skills.

**4. Cultivate Cross-Functional Awareness**
- **Learn the business context**: Talk to product managers, designers,
  or data scientists. Understanding “why” features matter is as
  important as “how” they’re built.
- **Look at metrics and KPIs**: Figure out which metrics define success
  and align technical choices with those goals.

**5. Drive Small “Mini-Projects”**
- **Take ownership**: Volunteer to lead a small feature or initiative,
  coordinating with other teams and defining milestones.
- **Explore “spiky” ideas**: If you spot low-risk experiments that might
  bring value, propose them. Even if they don’t go mainstream, you gain
  experience shaping initiatives.

**6. Get Feedback Early & Often**
- **Schedule 1:1s**: Ask senior engineers or your manager about your
  thought process, not just your code quality.
- **Ask for direction**: If you aim to think like a Staff Engineer,
  directly ask, “What am I missing that you see?”

**7. Document & Share Your Insights**
- **Write short docs or proposals**: Capture patterns or approaches that
  might help the team. It clarifies your thinking and shows initiative.
- **Post in shared forums**: Whether it’s Slack, wikis, or internal
  boards, share your higher-level insights to make them visible.

**1. Write Well-Designed Code**

- optimize for readbility and ability to change easily
- easy to test
- add comments to your code

**2. Always Maintain A Learning Mindset**
  - technology is always changing - keep learning

**3. Document What You Learn**
  - reading books, watching courses, following blogs are good but you must
  keep notes and document what you learn

**4. Look At The Bigger Picture**
  - junior developers tend to have a smaller focus while senior devs see the bigger picture
  - Ask yourself:
    - is what I'm doing consistent with how things are doing elsewhere in the codebase?
    - is this code going to be re-used elsewhere in the system?

**5. Take Responsibility For Your Work**
  - Don't assume bugs or errors will just get caught - think about the edge cases and make
  sure your code is tested rigorously

**6. Understand The Context Of What You're Working On**

**7. Have Open Discussions**
