# The Staff Engineer's Path

## Introduction

- three main pillars of staff engineers: big-picture thinking, execution of projects,
and leveling up the engineers you work with.
- This book is broken into 3 main parts: The Big Picture, Execution, and Leveling Up

## Part I: The Big Picture

### What Would You Say You Do Here?

- Good decisions need context. Experienced engineers know that the answer to most
technology choices is “it depends.
- Staff engineers are expected to understand bigger picture views - solution A might
be easier for the team but create headaches for other part of the org. Solution B might
be harder to setup but has more value for the org over time
- Staff engineering is a leadership role - you are one of the "grown-ups" in the room
- To be a good influence, you need to have high standards for what excellent engineering
looks like and model them when you build something.
- what matters is *that* the problems get solved, not *how*
> So you know you’re supposed to be working on things that are impactful and valuable.
> But where do you find this magic backlog of high-impact work that you should be doing?
> You create it!
- The four disciplines that are needed in any job in the world (*from Yonatan Zunger*):
1. **Core technical skills**: Coding, litigation, producing content, cooking—whatever a
typical practitioner of the role works on
2. **Product management**: Figuring out what needs to be done and why, and maintaining a
narrative about that work
3. **Project management**: The practicalities of achieving the goal, removing chaos,
tracking the tasks, noticing what’s blocked, and making sure it gets unblocked
4. **People management**: Turning a group of people into a team, building their skills
and careers, mentoring, and dealing with their problems

- at the Staff level, your work must be important. When you're an individual contributor,
doing great work on something that becomes irrelevant is okay because you don't typically
pick your work - at the Staff level, you don't have that luxury.
- **Task / Homework**: write out my understanding of my job and share it with your manager

### Three Maps

- The "Three Maps" are:

- **Locator Map**: your place in the org
> Your locator map can help you make sure the teams you work with really
> understand their purpose in the organization, who their customers are,
> and how their work affects other people.

- **Topological Map**: knowing the terrain
> Your topographical map can help highlight the friction and gaps between
> teams and open up the paths of communication.

- **Treasure Map**: destination and some points on how to get there
> Your treasure map can help you make sure everyone knows exactly what
> they’re trying to achieve and why.

- Do you understand how decisions are made in your organization?

**Recap**
- Practice the skills of intentionally looking for a bigger picture and seeing
what’s happening.
- Understand your work in context: know your customers, talk with peers
outside your group, understand your success metrics, and be clear on
what’s actually important.
- Know how your organization works and how decisions get made within it.
- Build or discover paths to allow information you need to come to you.
- Be clear about what goals everyone is aiming for.
- Think about your own work and what your journey is.

## Part II: Execution

## Part III: Leveling Up
