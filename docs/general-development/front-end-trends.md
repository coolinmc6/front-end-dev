### CM's List: 2020

_Note:_ these are the top items that I'd like to learn. The items are not based entirely on the front-end developer
predictions but also gaps in my professional knowledge, broader industry trends, and my own personal interests.

#### 1. JavaScript and React Testing\*\*

- I want to understand how to setup testing on a project, write effective tests, understand what it means to
  achieve "100% coverage". These following libraries / testing frameworks appear to be the most popular
  and should have staying power:
  - Jest
  - react-testing-library
  - Cypress
  - Enzyme

#### 2. React: Fundamentals and Advanced Features

- I need to get a better grasp of some of React generally. I haven't kept up with it as much as I'd like.
  Concepts like Hooks, Context API, Higher Order Components (pattern), etc.

#### 3. Python

- Python is a popular language used for data science, machine learning, etc; I'd like to get better at it. I've signed up for a number
  of online classes so finishing at least 1-2 and coming away with the fundamentals is key.
  - [Courses in Progress](https://github.com/coolinmc6/CS-concepts#targeted-computer-science-courses)
  - [Python Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/coolinmc6/CS-concepts/blob/master/cheat-sheets/python.md)

#### 4. React Design Patterns

- I'd like to learn 10 basic React patterns (HOC being one of them). I've seen some good lists somewhere but I
  want to take notes on at least 10; just start the list and if while working I see a goood pattern, I can add
  to it.

#### 5. Web Components

- This seems to be a trend that I should learn more about. I just want to understand why people like it, not
  necessarily use it everywhere.

**#6. TypeScript**

- I started a tutorial but stopped because of other career items. I want to learn this and should try
  to use this in my next React project.

**#7. Web Fundamentals & Future Questions**

- There is a lot that I don't know about many of these subjects. I need to start going deep on certain
  items and on the others that I don't have time to dig into, at least ask the question (record it somewhere)
  so that I have the basic frame to come back to. Questions on HTTP, CORS, front-end, CSS, the DOM, whatever -
  write them down in the appropriate repo. This includes future technology like WASM, micro front-end, etc.

**Optional: Web Assembly**

- MDN Intro to WebAssembly: [WebAssembly Concepts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Concepts)
- [AssemblyScript](https://docs.assemblyscript.org/quick-start) - a subset of TypeScript

#### Article Notes: 2020

**[The 2020 Web Developer Roadmap](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-2020-web-developer-roadmap-76503ddfb327)**

- _Note:_ This isn't really a list of trends but rather things that a web developer in 2020 should learn. Given that I haven't
  learned a lot of what's in here, I'm taking away the top items I should focus on for 2020.
- Web Fundamentals
  - articulate difference between HTTP and HTTPS
  - What is HTTP/2? What is HTTP/3?
- Web Security: I want a refresher / notes with links to these areas; I must learn these once, the right away, forever
  - HTTPS
  - CORS
  - Content Security Policy
  - OWASP Security Risks
- Testing Apps
  - **Note:** this is key. I've been meaning to learn testing for awhile but just haven't dug in; 2020 is the year!
  - Jest
  - react-testing-library
  - Cypress
  - Enzyme

### [The Latest Trends in Web App Development for 2020: What to Expect from the Industry](https://themindstudios.com/blog/web-app-development-trends/)

_Back-end Trends_

- HTTP/3
  - CM: what are the differences between HTTP/1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3? Give me dates, definitions, how it affects developers, and how it affects users.
- GraphQL
  - I've done some work in GraphQL but haven't really had to use it. Not a high priority for me right now.
- Bots and AI
- Nest.js
  - Nest.js is a Node.js framework that allows web developers to build scalable server-side apps.

_Front-end Trends_

- Web Assembly (WASM)
  - Languages currently supported by WebAssembly are C/C++, Elixir, Rust, Python, Go, C#/.Net, and Java
  - It’s also now supported by all major browsers by default, which makes having it under your programmer’s belt a great thing.
- Progressive Web Apps

_JavaScript Trends_

- GatsbyJS
  - Gatsby is a static site generator (SSG). I started learning it a bit ago and I'm not sure I understand its utility yet
  - the article says that it's perfect for generating ecommerce sites
- Single Page Applications (SPAs)
- Vue3
- Svelte.js
  - Unlike Vue, Svelte is a component compiler that runs during build time. This makes it possible to
    load only the components necessary for displaying your app. You don’t use a virtual DOM when you work with Svelte
- TypeScript
  - it is gaining popularity, is not new, and considered the "future" of JavaScript

_CSS Frameworks_

- Houdini CSS
  - Houdini is a collection of APIs that provide developers access to the CSS Object Model. What this means is
    that if you need styles that aren’t yet available in CSS, there’s no need to overwrite the CSS with JavaScript
- Bulma
  - Bulma is a free open-source CSS framework that offers a range of community-created themes with as few styles as possible
- Tailwind
  - utilizes Atomic CSS
- Motion UI Design
  - In a nutshell, Motion UI means adding action to your website’s pages to help your visitors understand
    the meaning behind an element — for example, by simply rolling out an explanation when the cursor is hovering over it.

_Other Trends_

- Data security and privacy
- Load speed

    - [https://medium.com/crowdbotics/the-best-low-and-no-code-mobile-app-development-platforms-53bc0b4f3558](https://medium.com/crowdbotics/the-best-low-and-no-code-mobile-app-development-platforms-53bc0b4f3558)
  - CSS-in-JS will continue to grow
