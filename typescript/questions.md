  <summary>Explain this code:</summary>

This code defines a type called `Props`, which is an object that has the following properties:

`app`: a string
`countryCode`: a string
`regionCode`: a string

In addition to these properties, `Props` can also have some or all of the properties defined in the `InjectedProps` type. The `&` symbol indicates that `Props` is a "intersection type" that combines the properties of the object on the left with the properties of the `Partial<InjectedProps>` object on the right. The `Partial<T>` type is a utility provided by TypeScript that creates a new type from an existing type `T` by making all of its properties optional. This allows the properties defined in `InjectedProps` to be either present or absent in objects of type `Props`.
