# Tailwind

**Explain what `h-[20px]` is in Tailwind.**

The `[20px]` value is enclosed in square brackets because it is a dynamic value that is generated by Tailwind's just-in-time (JIT) compiler at build time, based on the configuration file. This allows you to define custom values for properties like height, width, margin, and padding using any unit of measurement supported by CSS, including pixels (`px`), ems (`em`), rems (`rem`), and percentages (`%`).
