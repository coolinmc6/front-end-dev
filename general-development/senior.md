- Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apA-O6Qh6hs

1: Write Well-Designed Code
  - Write code that is easy to understand and maintain
  - keep things simple
  - optimize for readbility and ability to change easily
  - easy to test
  - add comments to your code

2: Always Maintain A Learning Mindset
  - technology is always changing - keep learning

3: Document What You Learn
  - reading books, watching courses, following blogs are good but you must
  keep notes and document what you learn
  
4: Look At The Bigger Picture
  - junior developers tend to have a smaller focus while senior devs see the bigger picture
  - Ask yourself:
    - is what I'm doing consistent with how things are doing elsewhere in the codebase?
    - is this code going to be re-used elsewhere in the system?

5: Take Responsibility For Your Work
  - Don't assume bugs or errors will just get caught - think about the edge cases and make
  sure your code is tested rigorously
  - 

6: Understand The Context Of What You're Working On

7: Have Open Discussions

8: Have Side Projects
